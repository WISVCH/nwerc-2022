## Languages

The following languages are allowed during the contest:

- C
    - Compiler version: 11.2.0
    - Standard: gnu17
- C++
    - Compiler version: 11.2.0
    - Standard: gnu++20
- Python
    - Version: PyPy 7.3.9 (Python 3.8.13)
- Java
    - Version: 17.0.4
- Kotlin
    - Version: 1.6.0

Note that Python 2 is no longer supported.

## Compilation of Submissions

During the contest, teams will submit proposed solutions to the contest problems to the Judges using the [DOMjudge](https://www.domjudge.org) contest control system (version 8.1). This can be done through the [web interface](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/8.1/team.html#web-interface), or using the [submit client](https://www.domjudge.org/docs/manual/8.1/team.html#command-line-submit).
Source files submitted to the Judges will be compiled using the following command line arguments for the respective language:

- C:
    - `gcc -std=gnu17 -x c -Wall -O2 -static -pipe -o $1 "$1.c" -lm`
    - Available as `mygcc`
- C++:
    - `g++ -std=gnu++20 -x c++ -Wall -O2 -static -pipe -o $1 "$1.cpp" -lm`
    - Available as `mygpp`
- Python 3:
    - `pypy3 $@`
    - Available as `mypython`
- Java:
    - `javac -encoding UTF-8 -sourcepath . -d . $@`
    - Available as `myjavac`
- Kotlin:
    - `kotlinc -d . $@`
    - Available as `mykotlinc`


## Execution of Submissions

- For each language, if the above compilation step is successful then the submission will be executed as follows:
- For C/C++:  the executable file generated by the compiler will be executed to generate the output of the submission.
- For Python 3: the main source file will be executed by the PyPy3 Python3 interpreter to generate the output of the submission.
- For Java: the compiled main class will be executed using the following command:
    - `java -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -XX:+UseSerialGC -Xss65536k -Xms1966080k -Xmx1966080k $@`
    - Available as `myjava`
- For Kotlin: the compiled main class will be executed using the following command:
    - `kotlin -Dfile.encoding=UTF-8 -J-XX:+UseSerialGC -J-Xss65536k -J-Xms1966080k -J-Xmx1966080k $@`
    - Available as `mykotlin`

Compilation and execution as described above will take place in a “sandbox” on a dedicated judging machine.
The judging machine will be as identical as possible to, and at least as powerful as, the machines used by teams.

[//]: # (The sandbox will allocate 2GB of memory; the entire program, including its runtime environment, must execute within this memory limit.)
For interpreted languages (Java, Python, and Kotlin) the runtime environment includes the interpreter (that is, the JVM for Java/Kotlin and the Python interpreter for Python).
The sandbox memory allocation size will be the same for all languages and all contest problems.  For Java and Kotlin, the above commands show the stack size and heap size settings that will be used when the program is run in the sandbox.
