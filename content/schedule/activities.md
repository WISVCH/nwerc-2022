Registration for an activity is possible through the form which can be found in the last information e-mail that was sent out on Tuesday the 22nd of November.

There are limited capacities for each activity, so  **full = full**. For the canal tours, it is important to be **on time** at the boat location as the tour boat will leave on time. NB: choosing an activity is optional, you are also free to use the activity afternoon as you see fit and thus not fill in this form.

  
The following options are available (you can choose only one):

At the [contest venue](https://iamap.tudelft.nl/en/poi/aula-conference-center/), Huawei will host a workshop.

_Cruel World of Concurrent Beasts -- Concurrency Challenges in System Software, by speaker Diogo Behrens._
_To take most performance out of the modern CPUs, developers have to make their algorithms aware of hardware peculiarities, such as caches, cores, etc. That greatly complicates implementations. As a developer, one has to face the dilemma between easy reasoning and best performance. In this talk, we will review challenges often neglected in university courses: concurrency, weak memory models, and NUMA domains. My goal is to raise your awareness to these issues and motivate you to think on how to tackle them in your future career._ 

_We provide the prize at Q&A session for the wonderful answers: Huawei Freebuds!_
