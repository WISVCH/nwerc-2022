For the 2022 edition of NWERC, we are looking for volunteers (runners) to help during the weekend. The NWERC is from Friday the  
25th of November to Sunday the 27th of November. The job of a runner includes helping set up the contest hall, joining participants in
activities, and bringing balloons and prints during the contest. If you want to volunteer as runner, you can fill in the form [here](https://wisv.ch/runner).
