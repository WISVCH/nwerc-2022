### Special Rules for NWERC 2022
Please pay special attention to the following section of the [official ICPC regional rules](https://icpc.global/regionals/rules).
This is relevant for teams that qualified for the world finals last year.
> In effect for advancing teams to ICPC World Finals 2022 from ICPC Regionals 2021/22 and ICPC World Finals 2023 from ICPC Regionals 2022/23 that permit holding these two World Finals as a single event and catching up on COVID scheduling.  Please read carefully:
>
> 1. A student may compete in only one of these two Championships.
>
> 2. A qualified student on a team that qualified for the 2022 World Finals may compete in this year’s ICPC Regionals 2022/23 which advances to ICPC World Finals 2023.
>
> 3. A qualified student on different teams that qualify for ICPC World Finals 2022 and ICPC World Finals 2023 will participate on the team qualifying for the 2023 World Finals. The coach of the team qualifying for the 2022 World Finals may request a qualified replacement. Details later.
>
> 4. A team that qualified for both ICPC World Finals 2022 and ICPC World Finals 2023 will compete in only one of the World Finals. The coaches of the team may request advancing another team that would have qualified so that they have teams competing in both World Finals. Details later.

>
> 6. A student or team that qualified for ICPC World Finals 2022 or ICPC World Finals 2023 together with ICPC World Finals 2021 in Dhaka may compete in both.  Note:  This resolves a multiple contest year overlap problem.

## Contest Materials

to bring any additional reference materials such as books, program listings and notes! You may not bring any electronic device
or machine-readable media (this includes but is not limited to cell phones, digital cameras, and mp3 players). You may bring
pens or pencils, but not paper (these will be provided). Winter coats, bags etc should not be brought to the contest floor.

Each contestant may bring a copy of a Team Reference Document. This document may contain up to 25 pages of reference materials,
single-sided, letter or A4 size, with pages numbered in the upper right-hand corner and your university name printed in the upper
left-hand corner. Text and illustrations must be readable by a person with correctable eyesight without magnification from a

Each team member may bring one printed, unannotated natural language dictionary. You may bring mascots such as stuffed

team needs at the contest, please contact the Head of Jury.

Teams are allowed to bring one keyboard to replace the keyboard provided by the notebook. Note that keyboards with pre-programmed
macro keys are not allowed. Wireless keyboards are also not allowed. A (single) mouse is allowed too, but is subject to the same macro rule as with the keyboard.
